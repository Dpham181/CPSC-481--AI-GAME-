# CPSC 481 Project

Bot name: Za Warudo

Description:
  Ai Capâ€™n is a video game project where a boat character sails to its destination on an ocean map while battling other boats along the way and avoiding any hazards without any player input. In this project, our team will program our own boat against others teams to see whose boat is the last one standing.  The program that helps our boat act on it own involves search algorithm such as breadth first search, depth first search, best first search or more.
